Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Face Generation


This is an implementation of Generative Adversarial Network Project as a part of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree. 
In order to generate human faces, I trained the network, using TensorFlow, on CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) to generate human faces.
The neural network was tested on MNIST dataset before CelebA.
